# Rebuy-Android

This is an android mobile project, which is a second-hand goods trading platform.

This project was completed by the team I was involved in, my job is a developer in the team. 

Due to the project is as the assignment of a subject of UTS the original github repository created by project leader 
is private, so I moved the repository to this one as public. 

The develop tool we used is Android Studio, and we also used Firebase Realtime Database as the Nosql database, and Firebase Authentication for user logging authentication.
